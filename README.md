# image-sorter

Image sorter program  which sorts JPG images based on the date on which they were taken. 
It sorts them into folders on a year/month basis. I used this to organise our home "collage".

## Usage

To compile the cpp program [easyexif](https://github.com/mayanklahiri/easyexif) is needed.

The shell script crawls the subdirectories for JPG files and can be run by `./crawler.sh`
